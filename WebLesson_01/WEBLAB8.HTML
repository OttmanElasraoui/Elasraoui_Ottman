				<h1>Marvel Contest Of Champions</h1>
			</header>
			<p>Greetings Summoners,

Change is on the Horizon in the Battlerealm! While The Grandmaster starts to make his power play for total control of the Contest of Champions, the Collector’s continued experimentation has started to twist and turn the very fabric of the Contest! It’s the dawn of a brand new age, and nothing will ever be the same again.

Everything you thought you knew about the champion’s stats, modifiers and the way they affect fights, synergies and everything in between is about to change. No longer will they be percentage based values, but flat values that grow and shrink as you level up and face challenges. Along with this, we’re bringing the ability to rank down a Champion to the contest, opening you up to being able to change your mind about Champions you ranked up long ago.

This post will cover off what is changing, and why we’re making these changes. We hope that you’ll take a few moments to read through everything, and we welcome any questions you may have once you’re done! 

Changing from Percentage based stats to Flat Values

From the beginning of the Contest, we have used percentage values to represent a Champions effectiveness when it comes to their abilities, block proficiency and armor, and when calculating factors such as critical hit chance and damage. While this worked in the beginning, over time this has caused a roadblock when it comes to continuing to develop and add new content for years to come.

We’ve quickly run into a situation where the old combat system was hindering us from developing new content and systems that could affect in-game combat in a meaningful way. Many players have noticed that a new combat-based feature hasn’t been introduced into the Contest since Masteries were introduced in early 2015. This was because our old combat system lacked the scalability we needed to make any changes to the core combat. 

To remedy all of this, we are completely revamping Champion stats and the impact they have on combat. We have converted all stats from percentages to new flat rating values. These values in turn now determine everything from critical hit chance, to damage reduction.

What does this mean exactly? Well, moving forward, all stats will be a flat value that will change depending on the modifications they receive from attribute modifiers like Synergies, Masteries, Debuffs, etc.

All Champions will start with a base for each of their stats. As you rank and level up that Champion, those stats increase and make your Champion stronger. Buffs, Debuffs, Synergies and Masteries will also no longer give you percentage based increases or decreases, but will add or subtract a flat value. For example, a champion that once had 30% Armor may now have an Armor Rating of, for example, 900. This will then change as you rank up your champion, as well as when you factor in Synergies, Masteries, Buffs, and Debuffs.

Why are you making these changes 2 years into the life of the game?

As we touched briefly on above, while the Contest has lived and thrived in its current state for the last 2 years, this change is necessary if we would like to continue to develop and add new content for the years to come. The old combat system was hindering us from developing new content and systems that could affect in-game combat in a meaningful way.

With very few adjustments, players were able to max out stats like Critical Hit Chance and Armor. While this made players feel very powerful, it also removed all sense of challenge and strategy from the game. 

With stats being maxed out easily in the current system, we weren’t able to develop and introduce new systems that could provide meaningful combat bonuses without just completely maxing out all of a Champion’s stats. 

Additionally, the old system also had very wild power curves between Champions, with massive differences in stats and how those stats interacted during combat. Our goal is to ensure that all Champions have a place within the meta of the game and none fall so far behind in terms of power that they are ever unusable. We were in danger of this becoming a possibility with the old combat system and decided to take action.

This new system takes that power curve and adjusts it so that the Champions at the bottom of the curve will come closer to the more powerful ones, and vice-versa. This will also allow us to introduce new systems that we have been hard at work on that introduce a new level of customization to the Contest, where you can tailor your favorite Champions to your individual needs.

Additional Stats

While we are changing the two stats that most are familiar with, Critical Hit Chance and Armor, to Critical Rating and Armor rating, we are also adding new statistics to each champion that will affect their performance in Battle.
Armor Penetration - A new stat that allows you to ignore a portion of your opponent’s Armor Rating with every attack.
Critical Resistance - A new stat that allows you to ignore a portion of your opponent’s Critical Hit Chance when they’re attacking you.
Block Penetration - A new stat that allows you to ignore a portion of your opponent’s Block Proficiency with every attack.
Challenger Rating - This is a new rating and system that affects all Champions. Taking a champion with a Higher Challenger rating into a fight against a Champion with a Lower Challenger rating will see your Champion Stats increase, while their fall. Challenger Ratings are based on the Rank and Rarity of each Champion.

How does this work?

The core of the system change is in a new diminishing returns calculation. Stats that were previously percentage based, such as Critical Hit Chance will be turned into new flat value rating. This flat value rating will be put through a new formula. This will then go on to determine the Champion’s chance to score a critical hit during combat. 

Players familiar with most RPG combat systems and the rules of diminishing returns will be familiar with this system. 

Basically, as any given stat approaches the top of the power curve, it gets harder and harder to make that stat better. Meanwhile, stats that are very low will grow very rapidly in usefulness when compared to naturally high base stats. This helps to bring greater balance between stats as all Champions can get a decent Critical Hit Chance but getting an exceptional Critical Hit Chance becomes harder.

What about Synergies and Masteries?

Aside from the update to the flat value system, Synergies and Masteries will not be undergoing any major changes at this time.

How will it impact Champions (more specifically)? 

While all Champions will see some alterations in the new system, some are going to see larger changes as part of the sweeping changes to the Battlerealm. These changes are being implemented to better close the gap on the power curve, elevating some of the less usable Champions and bringing some of the most overpowered Champions in the Contest closer to their level.

You’ll notice that most of the Champions on this list are ones that many players have been asking for us to rework, either because they need to be buffed, or because they just need to be made more interesting to play with to become more utilized.

Some of the Champions on this list are heavily utilized, but are an inadvertent “Easy Mode” in some of the most difficult content in the game. While they have long been too powerful and have remained that way, we cannot allow for them to continue to be the most powerful forces in the Contest and the end game goal for all players.

Additionally, one of the biggest changes that will affect many Champions is that Regeneration effects are all changed to be calculated off of base health rather than modified health. This will prevent Champions like Wolverine or Ultron from being unbeatable when they have a large modified amount of health (such as in Alliance Wars from buff nodes).

Will this have any effect on Champion’s Abilities?

While these changes themselves won’t have any effect on the abilities of Champions, we are taking this opportunity to make one big change. We will be removing Ranks from Abilities, and instead applying the max rank of that Ability to all Ranks and Rarities. This means that instead of having different ranks of Fury (Fury, Fury II, Fury V), or Armor Break as you rank up your Champion, their abilities will always match the highest possible ability of that Champion.</p>

The Discussion thread for this patch can be found HERE

UPDATE:

After enabling the Crash Recovery Screen with this patch, we discovered 2 issues that require us to disable the feature until they are rectified. 

Firstly, if a Player crashes in an Arena Battle and were put back into the fight, they would not receive any points for that fight. Secondly, a potentially exploitable glitch was discovered that allowed players to use the feature and return to a fight with buffs missing from the enemy.

We have disabled the feature now and will update you all when we have more information on when we can expect it to return.

We apologize for the inconvenience.</p>

		<h2>Patch 11.0</h2>
		<article>
			<header>
				<h1>Decent Patch</h1>
			</header>
			<p>Marvel’s “Doctor Strange” is in theaters on November 4th! There are powerful mystics at play, and the Battlerealm is not immune! Sorcerer’s Conclave has begun!

The Collector has organized a tourney for his many Mystic Champions, but something dark lurks in the background of this event. Doctor Strange, his old friend Mordo, and the enigmatic Doctor Voodoo decide to create a Mystic Council to uncover the hidden threat! As they travel the Battlerealm to gather their forces, it becomes clear something or someone is working against them...

The Collector has also added a new twist to the Battlerealm: Portals transform movement throughout The Contest, offering new challenges and new ways to see the Battlerealm!

As you battle through the Sorcerer's Conclave, earn Dimension Shards to unlock Dimensional Rifts! These short duration quests come in four difficulty Tiers, much like Event Quests, each with increased rewards as well! The items found here can be extremely valuable, especially in the Master difficulty Rift.

Dimension Shards can also be exchanged for Dimension Crystals, but the rewards they contain will not be as effective as entering and completing the Dimensional Rifts.

Dimension Shards for each can be found in:
Event Quest Completion and Exploration Rewards
Alliance Events
Solo Events
Dimensional Rifts themselves! Complete a Rift to gain Dimensional Shards for the next difficulty level of Rift!

Auto Fight is now available!
You can now sit back, relax and watch your Champions battle! This new feature allows the AI to take over for you.
We recommend that you use the feature when grinding with easier to medium level fights. While our AI is doing it’s best, it’s not as skilled as you!
Autofight is only available in Single Player modes of the game, such as Event Quests. It is not available in Competitive Modes, such as Alliance Wars, Alliance Quests, or Arenas.
AutoFight will be available at Level 19

Language Updates
New Languages added - Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese

UI Improvements (General):
A revamped Champion Info Screen showcases characters stats and abilities with more detail:
The Champion Info Screen has been updated and overhauled. Summoners can now get an expanded view on their Champion’s base stats.
The Champion Upgrade Screen has been updated to allow for the selection of more than six ISO-8 at a time, behaving similarly to the Stash.
Champion tags tell you more about your Champions. Find out which Champions are good targets for Magneto’s Magnetism ability, or use the new Champion types to know who is good for Offensive or Defensive play styles.
Synergy Bonus Displays on Team Bars

Bug Fixes:
Fixed issue affecting Phoenix's Max PI
Fixed bug causing characters to skip the evade animation and counterattack immediately
Fixed bug affecting amount of health regenerated after activating Phoenix's Right of the Phoenix
Fixed a bug where Scarlet Witch's Power Steal would activate with no effect. Each activation of Power Steal will deplete opponent's Power Bar by 33% and add 5% of stolen Power to Scarlet Witch's Power Bar.
Fixed a bug that allowed Vision (Age of Ultron) and Starlord to stack Heal Block
Fixed an issue where a Mystic Symbioid on Map 5 would activate a Fate Seal that does not Trigger Willpower
Fixed Black Widow’s signature so she can no longer break through blocking champs
Fixed Resonate’s info in Mastery tree to include the chance to activate

Character Changes:
Changed Juggernaut's base Ability to combine both his Armor Up and Unstoppable buffs at the beginning of a fight into the new Cyttorak's Favor ability. Juggernaut's Unstoppable at the beginning of a fight will now scale as he ranks up, from anywhere between 2 - 3.3 Seconds
Altered Mirror Image to attempt to duplicate opponent Cruelty, Precision, Resistance, Fury, Armor Up and Regeneration Buffs every 7 seconds instead of immediately. Duplicated Buffs will be in effect for 6 seconds.
Reduced callout for Power Steal during Rogue's Special 2 to One, instead of Once per hit. This has no effect of how much power is stolen, but simply clears up the screen.

Bug Fix for Old Man Logan
Later today we will be implementing a minor bug fix for Old Man Logan that will make quite a big difference. We discovered a bug that was causing his Fury and Cruelty Buffs to not have any effect. After the bug fix, Old Man Logan will deal significantly more damage when he goes Berserk. So get ready to bust out those claws once more!

This change will not require a new update, since the matter could be resolved server side.
